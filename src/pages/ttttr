I am building an educational platform for medical students in Algeria. The platform will provide structured access to medical lessons, organized by year and subject. The key features of the platform include:
Navigation Structure:

Users select their academic year.
Upon selection, relevant modules are displayed.
Clicking a module reveals lessons
Clicking a lesson reveals lesson details, including:
A YouTube video (or many videos) embeded. with full screen width in mobile
A button that open a pdf viewer popup full screen size (allow copy and highlight text) to show lesson notes.
A section to show flashcards related to the lesson with progress bar under them.


User Experience:
The website will be fully responsive across all devices.
The design will be simple, visually comfortable, and highly interactive.


Content Management:
I will upload all content (videos, PDFs, and flashcards) with an admin panel (use supabase for database).
User Authentication & Features:
Users can create accounts to:
Save favorite lessons.
Add comments on lessons.
Share lesson links.
A search functionality will allow users to quickly find topics of interest
